We recommend one unit for every 50 guests for events lasting up to four hours, with more needed for longer durations. For construction, one unit per 10 workers is standard. VES Portable Toilet Rentals provides expert consultation based on your headcount, site access, and timeline, ensuring you get exactly what’s needed without overspending.

ADA-compliant units are mandatory at most public events and serve an important purpose beyond compliance. Our rental advisors will walk you through these decisions so you avoid common mistakes like underestimating volume or skipping handwashing options  missteps that can cause serious discomfort and delay.
